== Devise Example App

I made a sample to cover a lot of the things that you guys will need for Devise tomorrow!

To get it running, clone it then do the following:

bundle install
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
rake db:seed
rails s

Be sure to check out the following files for comments:

app/views/devise/registrations/edit.html.erb
app/views/devise/registrations/new.html.erb

app/views/layouts/_navbar.html.erb
app/views/layouts/application.html.erb

app/controllers/registrations_controller.rb
app/controllers/users_controller.rb

config/routes.rb

Check the rest of the app just to see how it all works!
I used Devise and Bootstrap.
